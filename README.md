# ProjElectron

Hi everyone, this repository is purely educational. 

Its purpose is to learn a bit about the Electron.js framework, which is a tool for the front-end of desktop applications. 
Personally, I'm not a big fan of traditional desktop interfaces, so I want to learn more about this tool that helps make desktop apps more visually appealing and modern.
